title: RRDtool as a time series datastore for sensor data

![kuva]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/IMGP5937.jpg)


[RRDtool](http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/) is a *high performance data logging and
graphing system for time series data*. It doesn't have a query language such as SQL,
nor is it a NoSQL document store. Instead, you can store floating point numbers and
accompanying timestamps there, and configure some aggregates.

RRD in the name comes from *Round Robin Database*, which means that the size of the
database is decided when it is created, and once filled completely, the values
are overwritten from the beginning. RRDtool has accompanying software for graphing the
data called [rrdgraph](http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdgraph.en.html).

### Required hardware and software

1.  Raspberry Pi
2.  Ansible and clone of [raspberry-ansible](https://github.com/rhietala/raspberry-ansible)
    repository configured with correct IP addresses and SSH keys
3.  One or more DS18B20 or compatible temperature sensors, see
    [previous blog post]({% post_url 2016-09-04-raspberry-pi-and-onewire-temperature-sensor %})

### Installing temperature reading script

Running the Ansible playbook `tempreader-rrdtool.yml` installs a python script
that reads all connected 1-Wire temperature sensors to RRDtool databases (one
file for each sensor, files are created if they don't exist). It also adds the
temperature reading to be executed every five minutes as a cron job.

    $ ansible-playbook -i hosts tempreader-rrdtool.yml

After which the Raspberry's `pi`-user's home directory should have files like
these and a cron job:

    pi@raspberry1:~ $ ls
    0000075f24dc.rrd  0000075f5202.rrd  current.png  readtemp-rrd.py

    pi@raspberry1:~ $ crontab -l
    ...
    #Ansible: read all temperature sensors to rrd
    */5 * * * * /usr/bin/python /home/pi/readtemp-rrd.py

The first two files are RRDtool databases for temperature sensors with ids
0000075f24dc and 0000075f5202. `current.png` is a graph of last day's temperatures
from each sensor generated with RRDtool's graphing function. And `readtemp-rrd.py`
is the python script.

[Crontab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) syntax means that the command
`/usr/bin/python /home/pi/readtemp-rrd.py` is run every five minutes.


### Setting up a RRDtool database for time series data

Diving into [`readtemp-rrd.py`](https://github.com/rhietala/raspberry-ansible/blob/master/roles/tempreader-rrdtool/files/readtemp-rrd.py),
first imports show that we are using external library
[rrdtool](https://github.com/commx/python-rrdtool) by Christian Kr√∂ger for
using RRDtool from python.

The setting `DATABASE_PATH` defines where the database files are stored. Each sensor
has its own database file.

    DATABASE_PATH = '/home/pi/'

`create_rrd_unless_exists` creates an RRDtool database file unless one exists
already using [rrdcreate](http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdcreate.en.html)
(or its python bindings). The data definition syntax is not simple, but
first `--step` tells how frequently data is expected, `5m` being once every
five minutes.

Then a *data source* (`DS`) called `temp` of type `GAUGE` is created. Gauges
are for data that is just values which can increase or decrease over time,
such as temperature. Next number is the *heartbeat*: how many seconds may pass
without a new value before the data source is regarded as unknown, here
`900` for 15 minutes. -100 is the minimum and 100 the maximum value for this
data source.

`RRA` stands for *round robin archive* which is used for storing the read data.
Data is run through a *consolidation function* (`CF`), here `AVERAGE`. Average
is taken over 10 minutes (`2` data points) and database has space for
10 years: `525600` of these 10 minute average values, if my math is correct.
As the name suggests, when this time has passed, the database values will be
overwritten from the beginning. One 10-year database for one sensor takes 4.1MB
of space, so Raspberry wouldn't choke even if there were more than two sensors.

    rrdtool.create(
        filename,
        '--step', '300',
        'DS:temp:GAUGE:900:-100:100',
        'RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:2:525600'
    )

Current stable RRDtool version 1.6.0 supports giving these time arguments with
easier syntax so that you don't have to calculate for example how many 10-minute
periods are in 10 years. Unfortunately Raspbian Jessie has version 1.4.8 which
doesn't.

### Reading temperature sensor data with Python

The temperature reading part uses Timo Furrer's
[w1thermsensor](https://github.com/timofurrer/w1thermsensor)
python library, which makes the readings really straightforward.

Code loops through all the sensors, creates a RRDtool database for that sensor
unless it exists, reads the temperature value and writes it to the database
and prints it to standard output as well.

Writing to database uses
[rrdupdate](http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdupdate.en.html), which has
relatively easy syntax: first parameter is a timestamp (`N` for now), following
ones are values. `%.2f` is python syntax for formatting a decimal number as
a string with two decimals.

    for sensor in W1ThermSensor.get_available_sensors():
        filename = sensor.id + '.rrd'
        create_rrd_unless_exists(filename)
        error = rrdtool.update(filename, 'N:%.2f' % (sensor.get_temperature()))
        print("Sensor %s has temperature %.2f" % (sensor.id, sensor.get_temperature()))

### Graphing time-series data with RRDtool

RRDtool has functionality for generating graphs from databases included with
command [rrdgraph](http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdgraph.en.html).
Unfortunately its syntax is even more complex than database creation's.

But first, the following static variables are used for configuring graph generation:

* `LAST_DAY_GRAPH_FILES` is the path for current day's temperature graph file
* `COLORS` are used when graphing, first sensor's line is drawn with the first color,
  second sensor with the second color, etc.
* `SENSOR_NAMES` can be used to give the sensors meaningful names, which are used
  in the graph legend. Sensor ids are used if names are not given.

<!-- markdown requires a tag between list and code block -->

    LAST_DAY_GRAPH_FILE = '/home/pi/current.png'
    COLORS = ('#AA3939', '#226666', '#AA6C39', '#2D882D')
    SENSOR_NAMES = {
        '0000075f24dc': 'Living room'
    }

Graph configuration has two main elements here: definitions (starting with `DEF`)
and lines (starting with `LINE1` here). Definitions specify the data that is
used for graphing. Here `temp:AVERAGE` from each sensor's database file
is redefined as the sensor's id. Then a line is drawn for each of these sensors
with different color, and the line is labeled with possible name for the sensor id.

    defs.append('DEF:' + sensor.id + '=' +
                DATABASE_PATH + sensor.id + '.rrd:temp:AVERAGE')
    lines.append('LINE1:' + sensor.id + color + ':' + sensor_name(sensor.id))

Last read value from each sensor is also printed to the graph. Here I simply
couldn't get the texts to be right-justified and stay under the graph area.
`COMMENT: \l` is required so that the prints would start from a new line,
last value is read from `sensor.id` data, and it's printed after a sensor name.

    current_temps = ['COMMENT: \l']
    ...
    current_temps.append('GPRINT:' + sensor.id +
                         ':LAST:' + sensor_name(sensor.id) + '\: %4.2lf\l')

All this outputs a temperature graph for previous 24 hours:

### In conclusion

After all, RRDtool does the job is it designed to do. The database file is created
before any data is inserted, and it stays the same size no matter how much data
is inserted. This could be beneficial for systems that have limited disk sizes:
for example if RRDtool is used as a local datastore in sensors with unreliable
connectivity. That way measurements can be done even if there is no connection
to the master node, and data can be transferred afterwards.

Transferring RRDtool data between nodes would require another blog post.
[rrdxport](http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdxport.en.html) supports exporting
XML or JSON with specified time intervals, so that could be used.

Generating graphs is good for simple use cases, but ideally one would want an
interactive, zoomable graph with tunable parameters in browser. I spent relatively
lot of time to get the chart above, and are not that satisfied with the result.
